    <h1><center>WATER</center></h1>
    <P>water, a substance composed of the <i>chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen</i> and existing in <em>gaseous, liquid, and solid states</em>. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of <b>compounds</b>. A <i>Tasteless</i> and <i>odourless</i> liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. Life is believed to have originated in the aqueous solutions of the world's oceans, and living organisms depend on aqueous solutions, such as <em>blood and digestive juices, for biological processes</em>. Water also exists on other planets and moons both within and beyond the solar system. In small quantities water appears colourless, but water actually has an intrinsic blue colour caused by slight absorption of light at red wavelengths.</P>
